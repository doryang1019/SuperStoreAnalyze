## Abstract
This document served as Final Term Project for the course of CSIS 3860 Data Visualization, with manipulation on using the two most famous BI tools: Microsoft Power BI and Tableau. Comparing to previous assignments, this project we have further enhanced and improved the presentation to have better visualization on colors, structures, and comparison of data, also adapted the new techniques we have learnt from class and textbooks. Moreover, we have defined several analysis questions which need to be answered through the tools. In following contents, we are demonstrating the skills and techniques visualization charts, trend lines, filled maps, tables and more to presents the in-depth analysis in the form of analytical essay and insightful explanations from the data.
## Dataset
The chosen dataset is the Super Store US 2015 (Power BI Docs, n.d.). which is available online for learners to practice on Business Intelligent using data visualization tools, such as Power BI or Tableau. After our group discussion, we believe this dataset is ideal for assignments and beginners in data visualization due to its moderate size, volume, and coverage. It offers a good depth of data without being overwhelming, and its content aligns well with our specific needs.
The dataset contains information of orders, returns, and regional managers in three tables named:
1.	Orders table
Includes details such as order priority, discounts, pricing, shipping costs, order dates, profitability, and order identifiers. Also, additional information on each order, such as product name, category, order data and ship date. This table represents the super storeâ€™s sales and order management data with a focus on various factors that contribute to the overall profitability and efficiency of the sales process. 
2.	Return table
Includes the status of an order with order ID, it links to Orders with order ID
3.	Users table
Includes sales region and the name of manager in each region, and linked to Orders
